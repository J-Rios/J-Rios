Welcome to my profile! I create free and open-source projects, including hardware designs, firmware, and software. You'll find microcontroller firmware, scripts, bots, tools, and more, using C, C++, Python, and Linux.

Feel free to explore and try them out! If you find them useful, consider supporting my work with a donation via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.me/josrios) and help me stay motivated to maintain current projects and develop new ones.
